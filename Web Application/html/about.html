                    <p>
                        Application of machines to tasks once performed by human beings or, increasingly, to tasks that would otherwise be impossible,
                        Automation helps in making the work so easily made and the stress for human will be reduced and there is lot of advantanges in making a 
                        task, automated. There is lot of ways to make automation but here we a using a simple and cost efficient automated product.
                        Which helps in controlling the Water wastage.
                        Also we are including the process of taking the automoation into a smart technology wheres in water nowadays everything should be carefully gone through,
                        so the datas are been gathered here for futhere process as per the needs.

                        Industrial automation's main aim is to reduce the necessity of people in manufacturing processes. This 
                        allows production to speed up, increase in safety, and better utilize their resources and industrial analytics in manufacturing.
                        Where in here the IoT plays a major role in making the process of water management in a more intresting manner,
                        where this IoT helps in Automation and Data Aquiring etc., The global IoT Market size in terms of revenue was reasonably 
                        estimated at $300.3 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to rise to $650.5 billion by 2026, presenting a CAGR of 16.7%

                    <p>
                        The datas what we a getting about the water helps in giving away the knowledge to the clinet where how much of water they were been using daily,
                        and using this data the water consumtion is know in a naked eye, although we are getting a large amountof datas there will be process if data analytics in a another hand,
                        while we are getting the datas in out hands we can make use that data in whatever manner we want to handle it , so nowadays the information of consuming water is more important the 
                        need of water , because lot of people are starving without water , while this project can maybe atleast be a 1% of controlling the wastage of water.
